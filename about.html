                <p class="story-text">
                    Hello, I'm Linuka Arambawela, a passionate Computer Science
                    undergraduate at the University of Westminster, with a
                    strong interest in full-stack development, cloud computing,
                    and artificial intelligence. I am dedicated to continually
                    expanding my knowledge and contributing to innovative
                    projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always been driven by a curiosity for technology,
                    which has led me to work on various projects involving web
                    development, cloud solutions, and machine learning
                    applications. My journey started with small projects, and
                    now I’m excited to work on real-world solutions that can
                    make an impact.
                </p>
